# README for cpp-hello.snap
# Chad Young (chad_young@dell.com)

This is a basic "Hello World!" C++ program and converted into a snap. This snap
is meant to be used as a reference on how-to create snaps for Ubuntu Core 16
and as such would not be used in a production enviornment. As with anything you
find on the internet please proceed with caution as you never know when
Gremlins, Goblins, or Trolls will appear.  

## How to install
Install the snap that is created using the --devmode option.  

## How to run
From the command prompt run "hello-world-cpp.run" (minus quotes)
