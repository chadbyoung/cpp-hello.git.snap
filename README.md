This is a basic "Hello World!" c++ program. The uniqueness of this program is that
it is compiled via the snapcraft process (while using a make file)  

## How to run in Snappy
Install the snap that is created using the --devmode option

From the command prompt run "hello-world-cpp.run" (minus quotes)
